# Bleve Config

**NOTE** you probably do not need this package.  It is only intended for general purpose applications that want to include large parts of Bleve regardless of whether or not the code is directly using it.

## General Purpose Applications

A general purpose application, that must allow users to express the need for Bleve components at runtime can accomplish this by:

```
import _ "github.com/blevesearch/bleve/config"
```
